# 66. Plus One

# You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, 
# where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. 
# The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. 
# The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: digits = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
# Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
# Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
# Example 2:

# Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
# Output: [4,3,2,2]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
# Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
# Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
