# LC 48. Rotate Image

# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. 
# DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
